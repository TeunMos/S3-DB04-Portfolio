## Sprints
Because we are using agile in both our individual project and our group project we are working in sprints. 
In our group project we deceided that each sprint will take approximately three weeks. At the beginning of the semester we've made a sprint-planning for our group project, so we know which dates sprints start and end. for our individual project we decided to follow the planning for our group project.

At the start of each sprint we make a planning  which says what we are gonna do this sprint, we also do a little retrospective at the end of each sprint. We do that both for our individual project and group project.

You can check out the sprint planing and retrospectives for our **individual project** [*over here!*](https://github.com/IPS3-DB04-Teun-Mos-Lukas-Jansen/Documentation/blob/main/sprint-planning.md)
