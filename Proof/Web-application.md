## User friendly

> ***_User friendly:_** You apply best practices when creating user interfaces and basic user experience testing and development techniques.*

for our individual project we are making a dashboard application, so that you can view all your information/online-services at a glance. To make sure we have a good user experience we looked at a lot of comparable applications (such as [HomeAssistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/dashboards/) or Google home). 

You can find a lot more about the user friendliness and the UX/UI design of our application [Over here!](https://github.com/IPS3-DB04-Teun-Mos-Lukas-Jansen/Documentation/wiki/Documentation-Front-End#designs)

## Full-stack
