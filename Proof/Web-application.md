This file containes all the proof for the Web application learing outcome.
## User friendly

> ***_User friendly:_** You apply best practices when creating user interfaces and basic user experience testing and development techniques.*

for our individual project we are making a dashboard application, so that you can view all your information/online-services at a glance. To make sure we have a good user experience we looked at a lot of comparable applications (such as [HomeAssistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/dashboards/) or Google home). 

You can find a lot more about the user-friendliness and the UX/UI design of our application [Over here!](https://github.com/IPS3-DB04-Teun-Mos-Lukas-Jansen/Documentation/blob/main/frontend-documentation.md#designs)

## Full-stack
> **_Full-stack_:** You design and build a full stack application using a commonly accepted front end Javascript framework and back end application implementing relevant communication protocols, persistence of data by usage of ORM and addressing asynchronous communication issues.

Both the individual project and the group project consist of a front-end and a back-end, which makes them both full-stack applications.

### The individual project consists of these repositories:
- [A front-end made in React](https://github.com/IPS3-DB04-Teun-Mos-Lukas-Jansen/Dashboard-Front-End)
- [An api made in python (User-preferences-api)](https://github.com/IPS3-DB04-Teun-Mos-Lukas-Jansen/User-Preferences-API)
- [An api made in C# (Integration-api)](https://github.com/IPS3-DB04-Teun-Mos-Lukas-Jansen/Integration-API)

The front-end also uses Google API's for authentication and the integration-api is designed to use all kinds of external API's.


### The group project consists of these repositories:
- [A customer front-end (made in React)](https://github.com/Modus-1/customer-frontend)
- [A staff front-end (made in React)](https://github.com/Modus-1/staff-frontend)
- [order-api (Asp.net)](https://github.com/Modus-1/order-api)
- [menu-api (Asp.net)](https://github.com/Modus-1/menu-api)
