## Cultural differences

### Stakeholders
The most important cultural expectations the stakeholders have is that they value good/clear communication. They have made clear that if we're stuck or we have questions that we should always ask them. Because good communication  with the stakeholders will save a lot of time and effort.

### The group
In our group culture good and clear communication is also very important of course. We mainly use discord for online communication because we are all used to it.

#### Expectations of each other
It is also important for our group culture to have clear expectations of each other. We all are on different levels when it comes to programming and professional growth. And it is important to take that into account, mainly because we're all still learning and we all make mistakes.
