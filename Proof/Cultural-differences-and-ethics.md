# Cultural differences and ethics
>You **recognize**  and  **take into account**  cultural differences between project stakeholders and ethical aspects in software development.

> **Clarifications:**
> **Recognize**: Recognition is based on theoretically substantiated awareness of cultural differences and ethical aspects in software engineering.
> **Take into account:** Adapt your communication, working, and behavior styles to reflect project stakeholders from different cultures.

## Cultural differences

### Stakeholders
The most important cultural expectations the stakeholders have is that they value good/clear communication. They have made clear that if we're stuck or we have questions that we should always ask them. Because good communication  with the stakeholders will save a lot of time and effort.

### The group
In our group culture good and clear communication is also very important of course. We mainly use discord for online communication because we are all used to it.

#### Expectations of each other
It is also important for our group culture to have clear expectations of each other. We all are on different levels when it comes to programming and professional growth. And it is important to take that into account, mainly because we're all still learning and we all make mistakes. It also helps with planning if everyone knows at what level everyone is.

## Ethics

### Importance of Ethics in software engineering
Ethics in software engineering refers to the moral principles that guide the behavior of individuals or groups working in the field. These principles are important because the software we create has a global impact, as it is used by billions of people around the world. It is therefore essential that we follow ethical guidelines in order to ensure that our products are developed and used responsibly.

One example of why ethics in software engineering is important is to ensure that software is developed in a way that respects the privacy of users. If a software development team does not prioritize user privacy, they may create products that collect and use personal data in ways that violate the privacy of individuals. This could lead to serious consequences for the users of the software, as well as for the company that developed the software. By following ethical guidelines, software developers can ensure that they are creating products that respect the privacy and other rights of their users.

### The ACM Code of Ethics
The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) is a leading professional organization in the field of computer science. They have established a Code of Ethics and a set of ethical principles that have been approved by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) as the standard for teaching and practicing software engineering.

The ACM Code of Ethics consists of eight principles that provide a framework for ethical decision-making in the field of computing. Some important principles are:

- Contribute to society and to human well-being.
- Avoid harm.
- Be honest and trustworthy.
- Be fair and take action not to discriminate.
- Respect the privacy of others.
- Honor confidentiality.
- Respect intellectual property.

The ACM also provides additional guidance on how to apply these principles in practice, including specific examples of ethical behavior in different situations. It is important for software engineers to familiarize themselves with these guidelines and strive to follow them in their work.
