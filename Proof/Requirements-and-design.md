# Requirements and design
> **Clarification:**
> 
> **Multiple types of test techniques:** You apply user acceptance testing and stakeholder feedback to validate the quality of the requirements. You evaluate the quality of the design (e.g., by testing or prototyping) taking into account the formulated quality properties like security and performance.
## Group project
### Analyzing (non-functional) requirements
At the start of the semester our group got a paper with all the requirements from our stakeholders. That paper was divided into "Milestones" with the intention to start with the first milestone as our MVP and work our way up to the next milestones.

At the start of each sprint our group analyses this paper and creates user-stories based on the requirements explained in the paper. After we've created the user-stories we estimate the size of a user-story with a process called "Planning Poker". After that we split the user-story in sub-tasks and we assign them to our group-members.
### Elaborate (architectural) designs
### architectural designs
Our group made the design of the architecture together using draw.io. In draw.io we could easily colaborate together when making the architectural designs. We have discussed this design with our product owners. And if we make any changes to the design we will discuss them too. For example: we later added the gateway to our design and when discussing this with our product owners they thought it was a good idea.

#### UI/UX
For our front-end designs we used figma *(so we could easily collaborate)* and we also discussed the designs with our product-owners to see if they had feedback on those designs. We also look at a lot of similar projects to get a better understanding about the UX design *(for example we look at sites like [Thuisbezorgd](https://www.thuisbezorgd.nl/) or [Dominos](https://www.dominos.nl/))*.

> these designs may be out of date :(

### Test techniques
To make sure we are doing everything correct, everytime we change anything about our designs we look at our requirements and we discuss the changes with our product owners. We also make sure that we look at the user stories before making any changes, this way we don't do a lot of unnecessary work.
To test if the UI/UX is usable we let other students use our application. We also have a rule that when we make any changes, at least 2 people need to approve it.
