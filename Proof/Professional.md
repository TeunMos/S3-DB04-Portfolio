## Communication with the stakeholders
The first step to act professional is to have good communication with the stakeholders. On every Tuesday before each sprint review our group comes together to prepare for the presentation for our stakeholders on Thursday. On the Tuesday we also send a *"sneak preview"* to our stakeholders to give them some information about what they sould expect (and shouldn't expect!) on the sprint review.  the stakeholders have indicated that they like the *"sneak preview"* we send before each sprint review and that it was a good idea from us. 

In the presentation we give in the sprint review we tell our stakeholders wich user-stories we completed/not completed this sprint and if we made any big changes in our project we will tell them those too.

In our groups group chat we have a channel in which we type all the questions we have for our stakeholders. Then when we have a chance to talk to our stakeholders we have all our questions about the project at one place.

we sometimes also come up with proposals about a feature in the project (for example: *the gateway*). We first duscuss that with our stakeholders before we start with that feature.

### Disagreements
It can happen that we disagree with the stakeholders. For example at the sprint review for sprint 5  the stakeholders told us that they expected us to finish the project with all the requirements, which we just couldn't do. In that moment it was important that we communicated with them that that was not possible. They would probably be disappointed if we told them that but that is better than not telling them and they finding out afterwards.


## Our group
To make sure we are on the same line when it comes to our communication in our group we have made a [code of conduct](https://github.com/Modus-1/documentation/blob/main/Documents/Code%20of%20Conduct.md). Our code of conduct contains things like naming conventions and the definition of done. 

We have also made a [Group Contract](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O4WbgDgG3jcjnhj1aFvIqjnz9wh1FpvAaHZ_3k6U_-4/edit) for things like: division of roles and the times you have to be present. We later found out that 9 am as the time to be present is not feasible for everyone so we changed the time of the standup to 9:30 am.
