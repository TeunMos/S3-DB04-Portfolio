*A lot of our buisiness processes are explained in [Agile method](https://github.com/TeunMos/S3-DB04-Portfolio/blob/main/Proof/Agile-method.md) and [Professional](https://github.com/TeunMos/S3-DB04-Portfolio/blob/main/Proof/Professional.md) so this file is missing some things that are explained in those docs, so i suggest you read those as well.*
