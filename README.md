## Intro
Hello, My name is Teun Mos I am studying software at FHICT in eindhoven. This repository is a summary of what I did in the 3rd semester (*2022-2023*) and it contains the proof for my learning outcomes.

This semester I am working with [Lukas](https://github.com/LukasJansen100) on the individual project. For the group project we've made a github organisation which you can check out [here](https://github.com/Modus-1).
