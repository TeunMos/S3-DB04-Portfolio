## Intro
Hello, My name is Teun Mos I am studying software at FHICT in eindhoven. This repository is a summary of what I did in the 3rd semester (*2022-2023*) and it contains the proof for my learning outcomes.

This semester I am working with [Lukas](https://github.com/LukasJansen100) on the individual project. For the group project we've made a github organisation which you can check out [here](https://github.com/Modus-1).

The repo's for our individual project can be found [over here](https://github.com/IPS3-DB04-Teun-Mos-Lukas-Jansen).



## Proof
For a list of the learning outcomes of this semester [click here](https://github.com/tick-github/tick-documentation/blob/main/dict/learning-outcomes.md). *(made by [Erik Van de Laar](https://github.com/code-syl))*

In these documents you can find my proof of the learing outcomes for this semester:
