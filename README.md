## Intro
Hello, My name is Teun Mos I am studying software at FHICT in eindhoven. This repository is a summary of what I did in the 3rd semester (*2022-2023*) and it contains the proof for my learning outcomes.

This semester I am working with [Lukas](https://github.com/LukasJansen100) on the individual project. For the group project we've made a github organisation which you can check out [here](https://github.com/Modus-1).

The repo's for our individual project can be found [over here](https://github.com/IPS3-DB04-Teun-Mos-Lukas-Jansen).

### Documentation
- the documentation for our **individual project** can be found [here!](https://github.com/IPS3-DB04-Teun-Mos-Lukas-Jansen/Documentation)

## Proof
For a list of the learning outcomes of this semester [click here](https://github.com/tick-github/tick-documentation/blob/main/dict/learning-outcomes.md). *(made by [Erik Van de Laar](https://github.com/code-syl))*

In these documents you can find my proof of the learing outcomes for this semester:

## My Proficiency ratings
Here are my proficiency ratings for the learning outcomes:
|Learning outcome |My proficiency Rating | Clarifications | 
|--|--|--|
|Web application | Advanced (5)| **_User friendly:_** to get our ui/ux designs right, we looked at a lot of similar applications (like [HomeAssistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/)).  And we asked feedback from other students about our ui design. <br /> **_Full-stack_:** We have made a full stack application, using React as our front-end. We also made 2 api's (one written in python and one written in C#). The front-end also uses an external API from Google for authentication. And the API written in C# is designed to acces external api's. | 
|Software quality |Proficient (4) | For the individual project we've created unit tests for both our API's, and for the Integration-API we have also made some Integration-tests. All our tests run automatically in the CI/CD Pipeline in GitHub, and our tests are based on our user-stories. <br /> We also use SonarCloud as our static code analysis method for things like code-coverage. We also have a rule when merging that at least one other person must approve the code (in the group project 2 people).|
|Agile method|Proficient (4)|For both the individual project and the group project we work in sprints. At the beginning of each sprint we look at which user-stories we are gonna work on and we have a retrospective about what went well and what can be done better last sprint. In the group project we also have a standup when the day begins.<br/><br/> You can see the sprint-planning [here!](https://github.com/IPS3-DB04-Teun-Mos-Lukas-Jansen/Documentation/blob/main/sprint-planning.md) 
|CI/CD |Advanced (5) | Our CI/CD pipeline consists of using GitHub-Actions to build, test and push our code to docker-hub. We use docker-hub to store all our containers. Which we can easily pull using the [docker-compose script](https://github.com/IPS3-DB04-Teun-Mos-Lukas-Jansen#running-the-project) we've made. With that script you can run the whole application in one command. We also made one of our [research documents](https://github.com/IPS3-DB04-Teun-Mos-Lukas-Jansen/Documentation/blob/main/ResearchDocuments.md#how-do-we-use-oauth-20-in-our-dashboard-project) about deployment.
